Hi everybody. This is the first time I have published anything on the Internet. I would like someone to evaluate the html markup language code. I'm studying frontend development and have almost started learning CSS along with HTML. I really hope that I will start studying JS soon. I will also be very glad if you suggest any effective self-learning methods or just give some useful advice. Peace and kindness to all
